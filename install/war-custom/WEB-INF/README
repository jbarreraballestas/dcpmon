Directory: war-custom/WEB-INF

In this directory you can override any file in war-distro/WEB-INF. Copy the desired
file into this directory from war-distro/WEB-INF and then modify it. When you run
the build script makeDcpmon.sh, the files here will override the ones in the distro.

For example:

1. Modify dcpmon-header.html to have your own agency's title and logo.
2. Modify dcpmon-footer.html to have your own agency's links, disclaimers, etc.
3. Modify dcpmon-top.xhtml to add additional links, or remove unneeded links from the dcpmon top page.
