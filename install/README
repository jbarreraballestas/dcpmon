This directory contains files for building the DCP Monitor and related
webapps.

war-distro    This is the distribution from Cove Software LLC containing
              the stock DCP Monitor distribution.

war-custom    This directory contains files you have customized for this
              installation

makeDcpmon.sh Shell script that combines the distro and custom and then
              creates dcpmon.war in this directory.

You will need to modify/replace configuration files for each distribution.
Any file in war-custom will overwrite the corresponding file in war-distro
in the same directory.

For example, to modify the context.xml in the META-INF directory (something
you almost certainly need to do), create directory META-INF under war-custom.
Copy context.xml from war-distro/META-INF into war-custom/META-INF. Then
modify the file (to define database settings) under war-custom/META-INF.
